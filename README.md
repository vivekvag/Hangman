# Hangman

  Hangman is a word guessing game for two players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters. 


### HOW TO PLAY

   The code will generate a word which has to be guessed by the player. So, at the output screen of the user, dash line will exists, representing letters of a word. Then, player ONE will going to guess the word by inserting random word & the player TWO will guess the word by inserting random letters. If that letter(s) is in the word then the project will write the letter at everyplace it appears, and cross out that letter in the alphabet. If the letter isn't in the word then the lifelines of the player will be deducted by completing the diagram of HANGMAN (usually,six wrong attempt will complete the diagram of Hangman). The player will continue guessing the letters until he can either solve the word (or phrase) or he will end up losing all the lifelines and at the end, he will be shown the actual word with a prompt "Do you want to play again?"
